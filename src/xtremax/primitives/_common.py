"""Shared numerical constants and stable series helpers for EVT primitives.

The GEV / GPD kernels all reduce to two removable-singularity quantities as
the shape parameter approaches its Gumbel / exponential limit:

- ``log1p(u) / u`` — appears as :math:`\\log(1 + \\xi z)/\\xi` (via ``u = ξz``),
- ``expm1(a) / a`` — appears in the quantile and mean expansions.

Both tend to ``1`` as their argument tends to ``0``, but the naive quotient is
``0 / 0`` there — numerically ``nan`` in float32 and, worse, ``nan`` in the
reverse-mode gradient. Evaluating them through these helpers keeps the value
accurate and the gradient finite across the whole shape range, which lets the
kernels drop their hard ``jnp.where`` branch on the Gumbel limit entirely: the
formulas are smooth through :math:`\\xi = 0`.

    r"""Return ``(x - loc) / scale`` clamped only against literal overflow.

    Two guards keep ``z`` finite without ever distorting a physically
    meaningful standardized value:

    - A non-finite ``x`` is replaced by ``loc`` (so ``z → 0``) *before* the
      division. Callers override the value for ``±inf`` via their own
      extended-real limit; sanitizing the input here means a ``±inf`` never
      forms an ``inf / scale²`` term in the reverse-mode gradient.
    - The ratio is clipped to ``±sqrt(max)`` afterwards. A tiny (even
      subnormal) ``scale`` sends the raw ratio to ``±inf``, which would poison
      ``ξz`` and ``log1p(ξz)/ξ`` with a ``nan``; ``sqrt(max)`` is loose enough
      that both ``z`` and ``z²`` (the latter appears in the shape gradient) stay
      representable, and sits far beyond any real standardized value, so genuine
      heavy (Fréchet) upper tails are returned untouched. The deep-tail
      ``exp(-w)`` overflow is handled separately by :func:`safe_exp_neg`.
