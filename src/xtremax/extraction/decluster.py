    Decluster exceedances using the runs method.

    Identifies runs of exceedances and applies a reduction function to
    each run. This ensures temporal independence by treating each
    cluster as a single event.

    Parameters
    ----------
    da : xr.DataArray
        Input data array
    threshold : float or xr.DataArray
        Threshold value(s)
    dim : str, default 'time'
        Dimension along which to identify runs
    reduction : str, default 'max'
        Reduction function to apply to each run: 'max', 'mean', 'sum', 'min'
    min_separation : int, default 1
        Runs-declustering separation parameter *r*: two exceedances
        belong to the same cluster when fewer than ``min_separation``
        consecutive below-threshold steps separate them. The default 1
        reproduces classical contiguous runs (any single dip below the
        threshold ends the run).

    Returns
    -------
    xr.DataArray
        Array with the same shape as ``da``. Run representatives are placed
        at the last exceedance position of each run along ``dim`` and all
        other positions are NaN. For multi-dimensional inputs, each
        non-``dim`` slice is declustered independently (so run IDs never
        collide across slices).

    Examples
    --------
    >>> # Maximum value from each exceedance cluster
    >>> declustered = decluster_runs(da, threshold=100, reduction='max')

    >>> # Merge exceedances separated by gaps of fewer than 3 steps
    >>> declustered = decluster_runs(da, threshold=100, min_separation=3)

    Notes
    -----
    The runs method identifies periods where values exceed the
    threshold, merging exceedances whose below-threshold gap is shorter
    than ``min_separation`` into one cluster, and extracts one
    representative value per cluster. The reduction is applied to the
    cluster's *exceedance* values only — intra-cluster below-threshold
    samples do not contribute.

    Decluster by enforcing minimum separation between peaks.

    Identifies peaks above threshold and ensures they are separated by

    Parameters
    ----------
    da : xr.DataArray

    --------
    >>> # Peaks separated by at least 3 days

    >>> # Storm events with 7-day minimum separation
    >>> storms = decluster_separation(da, threshold=95, min_separation=7)

    Notes
    -----
    This method first identifies all local maxima above threshold,
    then iteratively removes peaks that are too close to larger peaks.

    Ties between equal consecutive values (plateaus) are broken
    asymmetrically: a position counts as a peak when it is strictly
    greater than its left neighbour and greater than *or equal to* its
    right neighbour, so a flat-topped exceedance yields exactly one peak,
    stamped at the plateau's first sample. Quantized observational data
    (rounded gauges, integer records) hit this case routinely; requiring
    strict inequality on both sides used to drop such events entirely.
    """
    # Identify local maxima above threshold.
    #
    # `da.shift` fills the edge with NaN, so comparisons at the first /
    # last positions along `dim` silently evaluate to False. Previously
    # this meant boundary elements could NEVER be marked as peaks — a
    # silent event drop for short windows or chunked workflows. Treat a
    # missing neighbour as "no constraint from that side": a boundary
    # position is a peak if it is strictly greater than its single
    # existing neighbour (and above threshold).
    # Plateau tie-breaking (equal consecutive maxima): require strictly
    # greater than the left neighbour but only >= the right neighbour, so

    Estimate the extremal index (theta), a measure of clustering.

    The extremal index θ ∈ [0, 1] measures the degree of clustering in extremes:

    - θ < 1: clustering present (dependent extremes)
    - θ = 0: complete clustering (perfect dependence)

    Parameters

        Estimation method: 'runs' or 'intervals'
    min_separation : int, default 1
        Runs parameter *r*: exceedances separated by fewer than
        ``min_separation`` consecutive below-threshold steps count as
        the same cluster. The default 1 reproduces the classical
        contiguous-runs estimator.

    Returns
    -------
    float or xr.DataArray
        Extremal index estimate (between 0 and 1). For 1-D input a scalar
        ``float``. For inputs with additional dimensions, a DataArray of

    --------
    >>> # Estimate clustering strength

    >>> print(f"Extremal index: {theta:.3f}")

    >>> theta = estimate_extremal_index(da, thresh)

    Notes
    -----
    The runs estimator uses: θ = (number of clusters) / (number of exceedances)
    A smaller θ indicates more clustering. Counting is performed
    independently per non-``dim`` slice so cluster labels from different
